// The object dialogs' behaviour, one definition per dialog: the model its describe answers, the draft a dialog starts
// from, the action OK sends (and the Script button scripts), SSMS's confirmations before it, and what happens after OK
// succeeds. ObjectDialogService runs the modal ones and ObjectDialog.tsx renders their pages (`dialogPages`);
// DatabasePropertiesService runs Database Properties, a document (src/renderer/src/properties). It is the plug-in point
// for later dialogs (Login Properties, Backup and Restore): a dialog id, its surface and pages in
// src/shared/actions/catalog.ts, a describe in the backend, a definition here, and its pages or sections. No React here,
// so the services and their tests stay in Node.
