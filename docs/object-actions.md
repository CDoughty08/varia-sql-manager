# Object actions

<!-- Generated from src/shared/actions/catalog.ts. Regenerate with: npx vitest run tests/object-actions-catalog.test.ts -u -->

Object Explorer's actions on objects: Select Top 1000 Rows, Rename, Delete and Properties. Which kinds and subtypes offer each is
data in `src/shared/actions/catalog.ts`; the backend embeds the same data as `backend/Varia.Backend/Actions/actions-catalog.json`
and re-derives the subtype in the action's own connection before any DDL runs.

## Actions

| Action | Menu title | Command | Kind | Menu | Group | Mnemonic | Windows and Linux | macOS | Servers | Context key |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `selectTop` | Select Top 1000 Rows | `explorer.selectTopRows` | query | `explorer.context` | `1_query` 2 | w | — | — | All | `explorerActionSelectTop` |
| `rename` | Rename | `explorer.rename` | inline | `explorer.context` | `7_edit` 1 | m | F2 | F2 | All | `explorerActionRename` |
| `delete` | Delete | `explorer.delete` | dialog (`deleteObject`) | `explorer.context` | `7_edit` 2 | e | Delete | ⌘⌫, Delete | All | `explorerActionDelete` |
| `properties` | Properties | `explorer.properties` | dialog (`databaseProperties`) | `explorer.context` | `9_properties` 1 | p | — | ⌘I | All | `explorerActionProperties` |

Keys work while Object Explorer has focus and no text field does. Delete's access key is E: Disconnect has SSMS's D in
Varia's one Object Explorer menu.
Select Top 1000 Rows follows Tools › Options › SQL Server Object Explorer › Commands (Select Top <n> Rows).
Properties is the last item, after Refresh, and is offered on SQL Server's own databases too, as in SSMS. SSMS 22's
access key and shortcut for it are unverified: Varia uses P, and ⌘I (Finder's Get Info) on macOS only, because Alt+Enter
is reserved on Windows and Linux.

## Menus, statuses, database states and servers

An action's item goes in `explorer.context`, `explorer.tasks`, `explorer.tasks.restore`: Object Explorer's menu, or its Tasks submenus. Tasks (`explorer.tasks`) and Tasks › Restore (`explorer.tasks.restore`) stay hidden while nothing is placed in them, so they appear with their first action.

A node's status badge (`explorerNodeStatus`) can overlay its row: a disabled login offers Enable in place of Disable.
No kind changes its actions by status yet.

A database row carries its runtime state as listed (state, user access, read-only, standby); a newer live status sample wins.
Rules narrow a database's actions by it, each with the reason a greyed item shows. The states: `online`, `restoring`, `recovering`, `recoveryPending`, `suspect`, `emergency`, `offline`, `copying`, `offlineSecondary`, `other`.
No rule narrows a database's actions yet.

An action can name the servers that offer it (`box`, `managedInstance`, `cloud`: an on-premises SQL Server or a container, Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure SQL Database);
the Servers column above says which. Menus read the server through `explorerServerEngine` and `explorerServerLinux`.

## Dialogs

| Dialog | Title | Opens as | Action | Pages | Steps panel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deleteObject` | Delete Object | Modal dialog | `delete` | General (`settings-gear`) | No |
| `databaseProperties` | Database Properties - <name> | Document tab | `properties` | General (`settings-gear`), Files (`settings-gear`), Filegroups (`settings-gear`), Options (`settings-gear`) | No |

A modal dialog is for a confirmation (Delete Object). A property sheet opens as a document tab instead (U1 D2): its
pages are sections in one scrolling column with a section list beside it, and a Script drawer under it.

A modal dialog with more than one page lists them beside the page (SSMS's "Select a page"); where the dialog is narrower
than 720 px (a viewport under 768 CSS px, as when zoomed in: the window is at least 1024 px wide) the list becomes a row of tabs above the page (a `tablist` named "Select a page", arrow keys, Home and End). A
page marked kept mounted stays in the page once visited, hidden while another shows, so what it holds (a running list,
a typed value) survives switching away. A dialog with a steps panel shows its plan as a list of steps, scrolling in at most 40 % of the column
(`kit/StepList.tsx`, Create Catalog's too), each pending, running, done, failed, cancelled or skipped, with an optional
progress bar under a running step.

In a modal dialog, the Script button scripts to a new query window; its arrow lists Script Action to New Query Window, Script Action to File, Script Action to Clipboard. Script never runs anything.
OK runs the action; Cancel reads Stop while it runs, and Stop cancels the statement in SQL Server.

Delete Object for a database also offers "Delete backup and restore history information for databases" (checked,
greyed for a snapshot) and "Close existing connections" (unchecked), as SSMS does. OK in the dialog is the only
confirmation.

The Table Designer (New › Table…) uses the same requests without being a dialog: `actions.describe` with
`tableDesigner` and a database, and the `createTable` action; its ids live in `src/shared/designer/catalog.ts`, and
[docs/table-designer.md](table-designer.md) describes them.

## Confirmations

An action that asks first (A13) sends main a prompt id and bounded facts (`varia:confirm-action`); main checks them
(names up to 128 characters, counts up to 1,000,000, at most 8 query window names, no unknown members), writes
the message box from `src/shared/actions/prompts.ts` with names shown through `displayText`, and answers with the
chosen button's id; Escape, a closed box or a page that went away answers Cancel. The page can neither word a prompt nor
choose its default. Database Properties' Open Connections prompt keeps its own channel.

| Prompt | Title | Buttons | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `renameDatabase` | Rename Database | **Close Connections and Rename**, Rename When Free, Cancel | 3 connections are using Sales (2 query windows in Varia). Close them and rename the database? 1 session has an open transaction, which closing rolls back. Varia's query windows with open transactions: Query 1.sql. Rename When Free waits until they disconnect; Stop in the status bar ends the wait. |
| `disableLogin` | Disable Login | Disable, **Cancel** | Disable the login app_user? New connections will be refused. 2 sessions connected as this login stay connected until they end; Activity Monitor can end them. SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER) runs as this account, and cannot connect while it is disabled. |

The default button is bold. Rename Database defaults to Rename When Free where Varia may not close the connections, and
Disable Login to Cancel for a login a service runs as.

## Long runs

An action that changes a server for seconds or hours registers as a long run (`LongRunService`) while it runs. Until it
ends, closing the window is refused with a banner naming it and its server, Disconnect of its server and Restart SQL
Backend are refused with "<Run> is running on <server>. Stop it first.", and main's reload prompt names it first
(the page reports at most 16 runs, server names up to 256 characters, and counts the rest; `varia:long-runs`).
A run shown in a modal dialog (Create Catalog) repeats a refused close or Restart in that dialog, which covers the banner.
While the backend does not answer, the run cannot be stopped either, so Restart SQL Backend goes on to main's prompt,
which names the run it would stop part way.
A long run never holds the document task, so nothing waits for it silently; main's drain of a stopping backend stays the
last resort.

| Kind | Named as |
| --- | --- |
| `createCatalog` | Create Catalog |
| `newDatabase` | New Database |
| `attach` | An attach |
| `restore` | A restore |
| `verify` | A backup verification |
| `newLogin` | New Login |
| `backup` | A backup |
| `shrink` | A shrink |

Create Catalog is the only long run so far; the others are reserved for the actions that will use them.

A short state action (a rename; later a login's Disable and Enable) runs as a status-bar job instead: one per node,
shown with Stop after `statusDelayMs`, naming its step when it has several ("Renaming Sales to Sales2: Closing
connections…").

## Database Properties

Database Properties opens as a document tab, one per database and connection (Properties on a database whose
document is open brings that tab forward). Its header names the server and the database, shows the database's
state in SMO's words ("Normal", "Restoring, Standby", "Normal, Read-Only"), and offers Refresh, Discard Changes and
Apply; Stop replaces them while the changes run. Its sections are SSMS's pages. General shows read-only facts as
text: backups, name, status, owner, date created, size, space available, number of users, memory-optimized memory and
collation. Files and Filegroups list the database's files and filegroups read-only in this version; Owner in Files is
editable (typed, suggested from the server's logins, or chosen in Select Database Owner). Options shows Collation,
Recovery model, Compatibility level and Containment type, then every option under its category: a boolean as a
switch, an enum of four values or fewer as a segmented control, a longer or server-supplied one as a list, a number as
a number field, and what Varia does not change as text. A row's whole description shows in a strip under the
sections while the pointer or focus is in the row, and as the label's tooltip; why a row is greyed and what is wrong
with a value show under it, and a section with a problem is marked in the list. Changed values are bold and say
"Changed" (part of the control's description for screen readers), and the tab shows unsaved changes.

Apply (also File › Save, Ctrl+S, and the close prompt's Save, which bring the document forward with its Stop) is
SSMS's OK that keeps the document open: it runs only the values that changed, reloads the Databases listing, and
reads the database again; if that read fails, the message says the changes were applied. File › Save All leaves the
document out, because its ALTER DATABASE can wait on locks. Refresh waits until the changes are applied or discarded.
When whether an Apply completed is unknown (the server or backend went, or Stop got no answer in time), the fields lock
until a Refresh, and the message says to Discard Changes, then Refresh. The Script drawer previews what Apply would
run while it is open,
once typing pauses; with nothing changed it says "There is no action to be scripted." A snapshot, a database that is not online or
not accessible, a database the login may not ALTER, and Azure SQL Managed Instance open read-only with a note.
Compatibility level is greyed for a login outside sysadmin (SSMS ignores the change silently), and Containment type
when the server's contained database authentication is off. The owner of master, model, tempdb cannot change.
On a read-only database only Database Read-Only and Restrict Access change, and the owner is greyed. Turning Database
Read-Only on cannot share an Apply with a change SQL Server applies after it and refuses on a read-only database (the
"Read-only" column below, and the owner): SSMS would leave the database read-only with that change failed, so Varia
says why and runs nothing.

Compatibility levels offered: SQL Server 2008 (100), SQL Server 2012 (110), SQL Server 2014 (120), SQL Server 2016 (130), SQL Server 2017 (140), SQL Server 2019 (150), SQL Server 2022 (160), SQL Server 2025 (170), up to the server's own.

### Database options

"Exclusive": SSMS closes other connections to change it. "Read-only": SQL Server refuses the change on a read-only
database (3906, or 5073 for COLLATE; measured on SQL Server 2025). "Not on": system databases SQL Server refuses it on
(Learn's master, model, msdb and tempdb pages). "Since": the version band (13 = SQL Server 2016, 17 = 2025).

### Statement order

Script and OK write SSMS's statements in SSMS's order (SMO's Database.ScriptAlter, then SSMS's own steps):

1. One ALTER DATABASE per changed option in SMO's order: containment, compatibility level, collation, then the SET
   options (WITH NO_WAIT, or WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE when other connections are closed), then the scoped
   configurations in the database (`USE [db]`, then `ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION …`).
2. `ALTER DATABASE … SET ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION`, as SSMS's SetSnapshotIsolation.
3. The owner: `ALTER AUTHORIZATION ON DATABASE::[db] TO [login]` in the database.

Each statement is one step; the first failure stops the rest, which are skipped. Statements are built by SQL Server
from constant text: names through `QUOTENAME`, numbers through `CONVERT` of range-checked parameters, keywords only
from this catalogue, and a collation only as `sys.fn_helpcollations()` names it.

### Open Connections

When Apply changes an exclusive option and the database has sessions (or they cannot be counted), Varia asks "To change the database properties, SQL Server must close all other connections to the database. Are you sure you want to change the properties and close all other connections?"
(Yes or No; No is the default, because Yes rolls back the other sessions' transactions, and Escape answers No).
No runs nothing. Yes writes the SET options WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE. SSMS counts the connections when OK is pressed, so
the backend counts them again before anything runs: when sessions have joined since the document read none, it
answers `IN_USE` at once and the document asks. The backend first closes its own idle pooled connections in the database
and, because SQL Server lists their sessions for a few milliseconds after that, counts again every 50 ms for up to a
second while the count is above zero. Without the prompt, WITH NO_WAIT makes SQL Server refuse (`IN_USE`)
rather than wait for the other sessions' transactions; SQL Server gives up after about 20 seconds. That failure advises
choosing Yes only after an exclusive change made without closing connections; otherwise (Broker Enabled or Containment
type with other sessions, which SSMS does not close connections for) it advises closing them first. Script never
asks: it always writes WITH NO_WAIT, as SSMS does.

## SQL

DDL runs on its own unpooled connection (the program name plus " - Object Actions"), never Object Explorer's or
scripting's pools, after a preflight in the same connection that finds the object again, re-derives its subtype and
checks permissions and name collisions. Statements are built by SQL Server from constant text: names are nvarchar(128)
parameters passed through `QUOTENAME`. DDL waits for locks without a timeout, as SSMS does, and Stop is always
available: the dialog's or document's Stop, or the status bar's Stop for a rename. A stopped action answers once SQL
Server has ended the statement, with each step done, cancelled or skipped, so the dialog or document says what completed
before Stop.

Deleting a database runs SSMS's statements in a safer order: Close existing connections (`SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK
IMMEDIATE`), then `DROP DATABASE`, and only after the DROP succeeds, the backup and restore history
(`msdb.dbo.sp_delete_database_backuphistory`). SSMS deletes the history first, so a DROP that fails (for example, a
query window still uses the database) would lose it; Script Action shows the order Varia runs.

If the backend stops while an action runs: "The SQL backend stopped while the action ran, so whether it completed is unknown. Refresh Object Explorer to check."
